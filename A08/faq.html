                    <h4><span class="toggle" id="q1">[ + ]</span> <span>What is the meaning of life?</span></h4>
                    <p class="answer">You'd have to ask that question to some guru (or monk) meditating on the Himalaya
                        Mountains, but
                        I can tell you now that it is not an easy one to answer. Just saying.</p>
                </span>

                <span>
                    <h4><span class="toggle" id="q2">[ + ]</span> <span>Where are you now when I need
                        you?</span></h4>
                    <p class="answer">First off, why do you need me? I can't think of anyone else who needs me other
                        than
                        my
                        bae.
                        Second of all, I don't even know who you are, so don't ask me if you don't know me. I don't
                        want you knowing about my daily whereabouts.</p>
                </span>

                <span>
                    <h4><span class="toggle" id="q3">[ + ]</span> <span>What do you mean?</span></h4>
                    <p class="answer">By what?</p>
                </span>

                <span>
                    <h4 class="question"><span class="toggle" id="q4">[ + ]</span> <span>Why am I making so many
                        Justin Bieber references?</span></h4>
                    <p class="answer">Hell if I know. I think you must be really obsessed with that sickly kid.</p>
                </span>

                <span>
                    <h4 class="question"><span class="toggle" id="q5">[ + ]</span> <span>You're really
                        good at answering the above questions.</span></h4>
                    <p class="answer">The intended tone of this statement seems sarcastic. I can't tell because this
                        is merely text on a web page. Give me a call or something. Oh, that's right, I don't even
                        know you.</p>
