      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>Hello, folks. We're NotAlone. I'm NotAlone, you're NotAlone, and everyone else is NotAlone.
         What does this all mean? Well, I like to put it this way:</p>
      <p>There are six, almost seven billion people on this planet we call home.
         However, some people still feel lonely wherever they are. It's understandable why
         you may feel that way, but that is definitely not true.</p>
      <p>We aim to bring together everyone, whether they feel that way or not.
         We want to eliminate that ugly feeling of lonliness, because it doesn't
         feel good. It never will. We hope you enjoy the company of everyone here.</p>
      <h4>What We're Made Of</h4>
      <p>For all you technology geeks out there, we're using a web development framework called Meteor
         to build the bare bones of NotAlone.com. For the aesthetics of the website, we're
         we're using Bootstrap.</p>
